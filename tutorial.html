If you're new to DOM scripting or JavaScript in general, building something as commonplace as a tabbed interface can seem a daunting task. It's especially difficult when you realize that your first instinct--searching for tutorials--yields way too many results, and many of those results cover too much material to be helpful to a true beginner.

I'm going to walk through, step by step, how you should approach building a tabbed interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a beginner-focused tutorial, but it's clean code and doesn't get muddied up in any dependencies like jQuery. It's just a soup to nuts guide to building tabbed interfaces for websites with clear explanations of the decisions throughout.

Before anything else, you will need to build a structure in HTML for your tabs. You will need this much at the very least-- two div tags containing links for the tabs and two more div tags where your content can live.

HTML

<div>
	<a>
	</a>
</div>

<div>
	<a>
	</a>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
</div>

Now, we can write the minimum amount of CSS needed so the div tags look like tabs. To keep it simple, I am using grayscale.

CSS

.tabs {
  background-color: #666;
}
.tabs__tab {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.8);
  color: #666;
}
.tabs__tab.tabs__tab--active {
  color: #fff;
  background-color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1);
}
.content {
  display: none;
}
.content--active {
  display: block;
}

Add classes in HTML

<div class="tabs">
	<a class="tabs__tab js-tabs__tab tabs__tab--active">
	</a>
</div>

<div class="tabs">
	<a class="tabs__tab js-tabs__tab">
	</a>
</div>

<div class="content content--active js-content">
	content
</div>

<div class="content js-content">
	different content
</div>

Now, your tabs look like tabs. We can now begin to bring them to live with Javascript.

Using "unobtrusive Javascript"

When writing Javascript, I like to separate my Javascript from my HTML in the same way CSS is separate. That way, the content, style and behavior are not all mixed together. When writing Javascript this way, I begin with writing the event listeners I will need.

All the code expect for the variables will live inside the window.load event listener.

window.addEventListener("load", function() {
});

After the window loads, we want something to happen when we click on a specific tab. Specifically, we want the tab that was clicked to look a different way, AND we want it to show certain content. Let's address the how it looks first.

var tabs = document.getElementsByClassName("js-tabs__tab");

for (i = 0; i < tabs.length; i++) {
    tabs[i].addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        changeActiveState(event.target);
    });
};

// Makes a tab appear "active" when clicked.
//
// tab - Node representing tab that was clicked.
function changeActiveState(tab) {
    for (x = 0; x < tabs.length; x++) {
        tabs[x].classList.remove("tabs__tab--active");
    };

    tab.classList.add("tabs__tab--active");
    tab.dataset.content;

};

At the top of the page, I created the variable "tabs", which represents a whole tab in the DOM. From there, I wrote a loop that will be responsible for handling when a tab is clicked. Inside the event listener, there is the function changeActiveState(). This function is what actually makes a tab appear "active" by changing the style. For each tab clicked, the class "tabs__tab--active" is removed from ALL tabs and then applied to only the tab clicked, or target.

I also added a dataset property to the individual tab, which is the beginning of creating a relationship between a tab and content. The next step is to create custom data attributes in the HTML which will allow the Javascript reach into the HTML and make sense of the relationship between the tab and its content.

<div class="tabs">
	<a class="tabs__tab js-tabs__tab tabs__tab--active" data-content="tab1Content">
	</a>
</div>

<div class="tabs">
	<a class="tabs__tab js-tabs__tab" data-content="tab1Content">
	</a>
</div>

<div class="content content--active js-content" data-content-for="tab1Content">
	content
</div>

<div class="content js-content" data-content-for="tab1Content">
	different content
</div>

Now that there is a relationship between the tabs and content, we can bring the next part of a tab layout to life in Javascript.

var contents = document.getElementsByClassName("js-content");

goToTab(event.target);

// Matches content with appropriate tab. Hides content from previous tab and shows content from active tab.
//
// tab - Node representing tab that was clicked.
function goToTab(tab) {
    var content = document.querySelector("[data-content-for=" + tab.dataset.content + "]");

    for (var n = contents.length - 1; n >= 0; n--) {
        contents[n].classList.remove("content--active");
    }

    content.classList.add("content--active");	

};

With the additon of the "contents" variable, I created the function goToTab() which will remove the "active" style from ALL the content classes and then will add the same class to the content that relates to the tab that was clicked.
