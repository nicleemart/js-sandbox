If you're new to DOM scripting or JavaScript in general, building something as commonplace as a tabbed interface can seem a daunting task. It's especially difficult when you realize that your first instinct--searching for tutorials--yields way too many results, and many of those results cover too much material to be helpful to a true beginner.

I'm going to walk through, step by step, how you should approach building a tabbed interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a beginner-focused tutorial, but it's clean code and doesn't get muddied up in any dependencies like jQuery. It's just a soup to nuts guide to building tabbed interfaces for websites with clear explanations of the decisions throughout.
