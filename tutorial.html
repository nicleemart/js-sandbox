If you're new to DOM scripting or JavaScript in general, building something as commonplace as a tabbed interface can seem a daunting task. It's especially difficult when you realize that your first instinct--searching for tutorials--yields way too many results, and many of those results cover too much material to be helpful to a true beginner.

I'm going to walk through, step by step, how you should approach building a tabbed interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a beginner-focused tutorial, but it's clean code and doesn't get muddied up in any dependencies like jQuery. It's just a soup to nuts guide to building tabbed interfaces for websites with clear explanations of the decisions throughout.

[Your tutorial goes here.]

To begin a tab layout, we will write the HTML structure for our tabs. This example will have three tabs with three corresponding sections.

HTML

<div class="">
  <a class="" href="#" data-content="">
    One
  </a>
  <a class="" href="#" data-content="">
    Two
  </a>
  <a class="" href="#" data-content="">
    Three
  </a>

  <div class="" data-content-for="">
    Content: One
  </div>

  <div class="" data-content-for="">
    Content: Two
  </div>

  <div class="" data-content-for="">
    Content: Three
  </div>
</div>

Our tabs and our content will be contained all in one div. Tabs will function as links. Data-content and data-content-for will be used for creating a relationship between a tab and its corresponding content in Javascript&mdash; we are just setting the framework now.

Now, we can write the minimum amount of CSS needed so that our div tags look like tabs. To keep it simple, I am using grayscale.

CSS

.tabs {
  background-color: #666;
}
.tabs__tab {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.8);
  color: #666;
}
.tabs__tab.tabs__tab--active {
  color: #fff;
  background-color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1);
}


Add classes in HTML

<div class="tabs js-tabs">
  <a class="tabs__tab tabs__tab--active js-tabs__tab" href="#" data-content="tab1Content">
    One
  </a>
  <a class="tabs__tab js-tabs__tab" href="#" data-content="tab2Content">
    Two
  </a>
  <a class="tabs__tab js-tabs__tab" href="#" data-content="tab3Content">
    Three
  </a>

  <div class="js-content" data-content-for="tab1Content">
    Content: One
  </div>

  <div class="js-content" data-content-for="tab2Content" style="display: none">
    Content: Two
  </div>

  <div class="js-content" data-content-for="tab3Content" style="display: none">
    Content: Three
  </div>
</div>

While I added in the classes for style, I also added the classes js-tabs, js-tabs__tabs and js-content. These will be the classes that get referenced in the Javascript&mdash; our Javascript will not touch any of our style classes.

I also added inline style to the two divs that we want to be hidden. Although inline style isn't necessarily the best practice and doesn't look the best, I find it is the least complicated way to show/hide content in this way.

Lastly, I gave our tabs and content sections corresponding names so that the Javascript knows which content div belongs to which tab.

Now that our tabs look like tabs, we can now begin to bring them to live with Javascript.

Using "unobtrusive Javascript"

When writing Javascript, I like to separate my Javascript from my HTML in the same way CSS is separate. That way, the content, style and behavior are not all mixed together. When writing Javascript this way, I begin with writing the event listeners I will need.

All the Javscript code will live inside the window.load event listener.

window.addEventListener("load", function() {
});

Let's declare a variable to represent all the tabs in the DOM.

var tabs = document.getElementsByClassName("js-tabs__tab");

After the window loads, we want something to happen when we click on a specific tab. Specifically, we want the tab that was clicked to look a different way, AND we want it to show certain content. Let's address the how it looks first.

for (i = 0; i < tabs.length; i++) {
    tabs[i].addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        changeActiveState(event.target);
    });
};

// Makes a tab appear "active" when clicked.
//
// tab - Node representing tab that was clicked.
function changeActiveState(tab) {
    for (x = 0; x < tabs.length; x++) {
        tabs[x].classList.remove("tabs__tab--active");
    };

    tab.classList.add("tabs__tab--active");
    tab.dataset.content;

};

I wrote a loop that will be responsible for handling when a tab is clicked. Inside the event listener, there is the function changeActiveState(). This function is what actually makes a tab appear "active" by changing the style. For each tab clicked, the class "tabs__tab--active" is removed from ALL tabs and then applied to only the tab clicked, or target.






var contents = document.getElementsByClassName("js-content");

goToTab(event.target);

// Matches content with appropriate tab. Hides content from previous tab and shows content from active tab.
//
// tab - Node representing tab that was clicked.
function goToTab(tab) {
    var content = document.querySelector("[data-content-for=" + tab.dataset.content + "]");

    for (var n = contents.length - 1; n >= 0; n--) {
        contents[n].classList.remove("content--active");
    }

    content.classList.add("content--active");	

};

With the additon of the "contents" variable, I created the function goToTab() which will remove the "active" style from ALL the content classes and then will add the same class to the content that relates to the tab that was clicked.
